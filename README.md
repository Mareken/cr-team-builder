# Chess Rush Team Builder

Build your team and share with your friends 😉

## Overview

A simple yet effective team builder for the popular mobile game Chess Rush, by Tencent Games. Without any involvement with the company, this project is based on other popular online team builders, like [TFTactics](https://tftactics.gg/team-builder) and [LoLChess](https://lolchess.gg/builder).

## Technologies

This project was bootstraped with ⚛️ [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Although it's now full TypeScript, initially the project was JavaScript, and later migrated to TS. Since it's not a big and complex project, the Context API from React for global state management was the go to option.
For styling, the choice was styled-components 💅
