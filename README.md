## Disclaimer

Since the game was discontinued and removed from the mobile stores by Tencent, there's no point on maintaining the webapp active. The repository will still be public, here, but the webapp will not be online.

## Technologies

This project was bootstraped with ⚛️ [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Although it's now full TypeScript, initially the project was JavaScript, and later migrated to TS. Since it's not a big and complex project, the Context API from React for global state management was the go to option.
For styling, the choice was styled-components 💅
