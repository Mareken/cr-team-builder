# Chess Rush Team Builder

Build your team and share with your friends ðŸ˜‰
## Overview

A simple yet effective team builder for the popular mobile game Chess Rush, by Tencent Games. Without any involvement with the company, this project is based on other popular online team builders, like [TFTactics](https://tftactics.gg/team-builder) and [LoLChess](https://lolchess.gg/builder).
## Technologies

This project was created using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Since it's not a big and complex project, the Context API from React for global state management was the go to.
For styling, the choice was styled-components.
